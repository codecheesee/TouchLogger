# TouchDetect
A Touch Detecting Application for Android developed on 1/07/21

The Touch Logger Android app is a tool developed in Android Studio that allows users to detect touches on their mobile screen and maintain a log of these touch events. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface to track touch activities, providing valuable insights for various use cases, such as testing, debugging, or monitoring user interactions with the device.

Key Features:

    Touch Detection: The app utilizes Android's touch event handling mechanism to capture touch interactions on the screen. When the app is opened, it continuously listens for touch events.

    Touch Logging: Each detected touch event is logged with relevant information, including the timestamp of the touch, the coordinates (x, y) where the touch occurred, and the type of touch (e.g., touch down, touch up, touch move).

    User-Friendly Interface: The app's user interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly. It may include a large button or a toggle switch to start and stop touch logging.

    Persistent Log Storage: The app ensures that the touch logs are stored persistently, either locally on the device's storage or in the cloud, depending on the developer's implementation.
